This is an article about politicians getting reelected even being probike. There are some opposition but those don't translate to votes.

Here are the politicians and what they did:

-   Milan’s mayor, Giuseppe Sala, earlier this month won reelection after reclaiming 22,000 sq meters of vehicle lanes to create 38 neighbourhood plazas over three years and 22 miles (35km) of cycling and walking space on main travel corridors
-   London’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, won reelection in May after creating or completing 160 miles (260km) of new bike routes. Faced with an opponent who vocally opposed improvements for cycling and walking, the Labour mayor won 55% of the vote in the runoff.
-   Paris: Anne Hidalgo, second term, spurred a cycling golden age, building hundreds of kilometres of bike lanes, turning the crosstown Rue de Rivoli into a churning bike- and bus-priority corridor, and pedestrianised a highway along the right bank of the Seine. Intense opposition and driver protests did not translate into votes: Hidalgo won by a margin of 18 percentage points in the second round of voting.

-   Clover Moore in Sydney has already won three reelections despite strong blowback to her pro-cycling agenda; she is now running to win a fifth term in December.
-   Tel Aviv’s electorate reelected Ron Huldai partly owing to his bike-lane and pedestrian space actions
