This is a myth. Studies have shown that replacing parking spaces to accommodate bike infrastructure has little to zero negative impact. In fact, it can actually boost sales.

A lot of charts to suggest that taking away lanes and parking has no negative impact. Even though they spend less, they take more trips. So I'm not sure if you can use this as a reference when trying to do car free day.

A study done on restaurant owners on what is their perception on how many people drives. Spoiler alert: they were wrong. On a side note, most of the revenue comes from non-car people.

At 9:56, merchants even want all parking gone so that it is more accessible for pedestrians because sales are better. This clip is taken from [Utrecht: Planning for People &amp; Bikes, Not for Cars - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boi0XEm9-4E). You can see it at 4:25.

The traders overestimate how much of their customers are driving when in fact, most of the their customers come to the shop via walking.

By making their place more walkable, they are able to get brand loyalty from their local customers.

> They recognised that their largest and most loyal customer group was actually local. Improving the walking environment for them was likely to actually increase their loyalty and might help attract them back to the area more often – which would translate into a bonus for local business.

> In Valencia Street, San Francisco, traffic lanes were slimmed to slow down cars and accommodate other road users. Nearly 40% of merchants reported increased sales. More than 60% reported an increase in the number of customers who ride bicycles.

> New York implemented a raft of changes across the city including traffic calming, separated and protected bike lanes, and dedicated bicycle signals which resulted in significant rises in retail sales.

<!--quoteend-->

> In Bloor Street, Toronto, a study of merchants and patrons found only 10% of patrons drove to the area.

People tend to overestimate the number of people who drove to their shops.

In the 70s, business owners were against the idea of making the city center car free [3:48]. But cars don't do the shopping. People do. Now, when the city wanted to remove bicycle parking spaces during COVID but the business owners were against that. It's the total opposite from the 70s. [5:37]

<!--quoteend-->

> Furthermore, a pivotal report by Elizabeth Bent and Krute Singha of the San Francisco County Transportation Authority uncovered that "travelers using [transit or walking] spend more per month than those traveling by car." Interestingly, while the amount that transit users and walkers spent at area businesses on each trip was less than the average car driver's spending, the transit users and walkers made more trips per month, which added up to higher spending overall.

Retailers always overestimate how much people come to their shops via cars when in fact this study in Berlin states otherwise:

> The researchers surveyed around 2,000 customers and 145 retailers on Kottbusser Damm (Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg district) and Hermannstraße (Neukölln district). The vast majority of shoppers - 93 per cent - had not travelled to their destination by car. 91 per cent of the revenue generated by these businesses came out of the wallets of customers who walked, cycled or used public transport to reach them. Customers that drive to the shops accounted for just 9 per cent of sales.

-   <https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/u1hfqw/half_of_business_owners_on_this_toronto_street/i4cqv0k/>

In this study, they found that:

1.  Less than 1 out of 5 visitors to Danforth Avenue claimed a personal vehicle as their chosen mode of transportation to the area
2.  Those that drove to the Danforth spent less money than people who used other modes of transportation
3.  Visitors to the Danforth would prefer to see widened sidewalks, bike lanes, less onstreet parking and an increase in off-street parking. Merchants, however, generally preferred no changes to the current street allocation, or an increase in parking.

They also found that the majority (81%) of the visitors to Danforth Avenue use public transit, walk, cycle or take taxicabs.

Due to this, bike lanes on Bloor Street were made permanent in November 2017.
