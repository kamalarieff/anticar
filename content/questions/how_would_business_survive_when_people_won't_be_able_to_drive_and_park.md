This is a myth. Studies have shown that replacing parking spaces to accommodate bike infrastructure has little to zero negative impact. In fact, it can actually boost sales.

A lot of charts to suggest that taking away lanes and parking has no negative impact. Even though they spend less, they take more trips. So I'm not sure if you can use this as a reference when trying to do car free day.

A study done on restaurant owners on what is their perception on how many people drives. Spoiler alert: they were wrong. On a side note, most of the revenue comes from non-car people.

At 9:56, merchants even want all parking gone so that it is more accessible for pedestrians because sales are better. This clip is taken from [Utrecht: Planning for People & Bikes, Not for Cars - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Boi0XEm9-4E). You can see it at 4:25.

At 10:12, there is a 10% boost in sales in Madrid.

The traders overestimate how much of their customers are driving when in fact, most of the their customers come to the shop via walking.

By making their place more walkable, they are able to get brand loyalty from their local customers.

> They recognised that their largest and most loyal customer group was actually local. Improving the walking environment for them was likely to actually increase their loyalty and might help attract them back to the area more often â€“ which would translate into a bonus for local business.

> In Valencia Street, San Francisco, traffic lanes were slimmed to slow down cars and accommodate other road users. Nearly 40% of merchants reported increased sales. More than 60% reported an increase in the number of customers who ride bicycles.

> New York implemented a raft of changes across the city including traffic calming, separated and protected bike lanes, and dedicated bicycle signals which resulted in significant rises in retail sales.

> In Bloor Street, Toronto, a study of merchants and patrons found only 10% of patrons drove to the area.

People tend to overestimate the number of people who drove to their shops.
