Your vision gets smaller when you drive faster. When drivers drive slower, they yield more for pedestrians.

It's just an infographic though. It'd be nice if there is an official source or a study.

There's a study in the comments about how speed affects your vision.

The source of this post comes from the Seattle DOT: <https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/safety-first/vision-zero/speedlimits>. In this post, there is a link to a study on speed limits:

> When SDOT signed streets for 25 mph, the data showed total crashes decline, injury crashes decline, 50th percentile speeds decline, 85th percentile speeds decline, and high-end speeding decline for every location reviewed.
