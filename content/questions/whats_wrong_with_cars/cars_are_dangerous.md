Death numbers globally.

> Road traffic crashes are a leading cause of death in the United States for people aged 1–54,1 and they are the leading cause of nonnatural death for U.S. citizens residing or traveling abroad.

<!--quoteend-->

> Each year, 1.35 million people are killed on roadways around the world.

<!--quoteend-->

> Every day, almost 3,700 people are killed globally in crashes involving cars, buses, motorcycles, bicycles, trucks, or pedestrians. More than half of those killed are pedestrians, motorcyclists, or cyclists.

<!--quoteend-->

> Crash injuries are estimated to be the eighth leading cause of death globally for all age groups and the leading cause of death for children and young people 5–29 years of age. More people now die in crashes than from HIV/AIDS.

## Here’s How Much Safer Transit Is Compared to Driving – Streetsblog USA {#here-s-how-much-safer-transit-is-compared-to-driving-streetsblog-usa}

<https://usa.streetsblog.org/2014/12/19/heres-how-much-safer-transit-is-compared-to-driving/>

-   <https://reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/v11oyp/my_mom_dislikes_the_idea_of_me_taking_public_bus/iak01vn/>

People always has this perception that public transit is unsafe but that's further from the truth.

> Looking at traffic fatalities per mile traveled in the U.S., analyst Todd Litman found that riding commuter or intercity rail is about 20 times safer than driving; riding metro or light rail is about 30 times safer; and riding the bus is about 60 times safer.

<!--quoteend-->

> In media coverage and in transit agencies’ own public messaging campaigns, transit is often linked to the threat of terrorism, but internationally, Litman notes, about 360 times more people are killed in auto collisions than in incidents of terrorism.

This is further supported in <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_5">[5]</a> where over the last 10 years, passenger vehicle death rate per 100,000,000 passenger miles was over 9 times higher than for buses, 17 times higher than for passenger trains, and 1,606 times higher than for scheduled airlines.

Your vision gets smaller when you drive faster. When drivers drive slower, they yield more for pedestrians.

It's just an infographic though. It'd be nice if there is an official source or a study.

There's a study in the comments about how speed affects your vision.

The source of this post comes from the Seattle DOT: <https://www.seattle.gov/transportation/projects-and-programs/safety-first/vision-zero/speedlimits>. In this post, there is a link to a study on speed limits:

> When SDOT signed streets for 25 mph, the data showed total crashes decline, injury crashes decline, 50th percentile speeds decline, 85th percentile speeds decline, and high-end speeding decline for every location reviewed.

Bad car infrastructure can also kill you not just through accidents. These people die when they were stranded in the snow. If you can't maintain safe and proper infrastructure, maybe it's time to invest in cheaper and better infrastructure in the form of public transportation.

> “Your risk of getting killed on the subway or in a subway station is much higher in New York City than in a place with no subway, for example, but if you add up all risks related to getting to work or school or wherever else it is you need to go, it’s a different story. New Yorkers are only about as third as likely to die in transportation accidents of any kind as Americans are overall. Put homicide and transportation risks together, and New York starts looking like a refuge from the American carnage.”

A city becomes more dangerous to live in it's filled with cars.
