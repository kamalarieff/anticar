SUVs are not good for the environment. It is very shocking that just SUVs are second behind an entire industry. They are not aerodynamic, consumes a lot of gas.

> SUVs were the second largest cause of the global rise in carbon dioxide emissions over the past decade, eclipsing all shipping, aviation, heavy industry and even trucks, usually the only vehicles to loom larger than them on the road.

There is just this number. I don't think it is useful to use in an argument. You need something to compare with. Maybe compare it with cycling or walking.

They pollute.

> Harvard University researchers who study the environment and public health examined the impact of declines in emissions from vehicles over a decade. They found deaths dropped from 27,700 in 2008 to 19,800 in 2017 and that the economic benefits of the reduction in emissions totaled $270 billion.

Transport emit CO2 emissions. Here are some numbers from the article:

> Road travel accounts for three-quarters of transport emissions. Most of this comes from passenger vehicles – cars and buses.

Cars emit these type of particles.

A good quote from the author:

> “Reducing fossil fuel-powered transportation can help children and adults breathe easier and may pay big health dividends, such as fewer cases of pediatric asthma and excess deaths,” Anenberg said. “At the same time, it would also reduce greenhouse gas emissions, leading to a healthier climate.”

Asphalt used in roads pollute. It'd be best if we can reduce the amount of roads so that ultimately we reduce the amount of pollution.

> A main finding is that asphalt-related products emit substantial and diverse mixtures of organic compounds into the air, with a strong dependence on temperature and other environmental conditions

The salt used to de-ice the roads have environmental consequences. The salt used is contaminating the wells and affecting the sodium concentration thereby harming people with low-sodium and moderate-sodium diets.

Wildlife are affected too.

> elevated salinity levels in freshwater ecosystems had already caused a reduction in the abundance and growth of freshwater organisms and a reduction in their reproduction outputs.

Besides that,
