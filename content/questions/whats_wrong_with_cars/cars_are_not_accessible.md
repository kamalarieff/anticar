From <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_1">[1]</a>, there are 4 groups of people are affected by car-based design:

1.  Children and Teenagers
2.  Stay-at-Home Parents
3.  The Income-Vulnerable
4.  Senior Citizens

Once the infrastructure for cars gets bad enough, they're entirely useless. This is what happened in Toronto. Cars getting stuck in the snow making the owners abandon them. It would also take a long time to clear these roads <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_2">[2]</a>.

> The city’s mayor, John Tory, warned on Tuesday that it would take days to get the roads fully cleared, and 600 road plows, 360 sidewalk plows and 200 salt trucks were deployed.

Many people with disablities are unable to drive <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_3">[3]</a>. But they can use their mobility scooters on the pedestrian paths and bike lanes.

Car infrastructure is not equitable for everyone. It hurts the poor more than the rich. Everyone pays for roads even if they don't drive <a href="#citeproc_bib_item_4">[4]</a>.
