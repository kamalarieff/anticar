At 14:03, Houston is home to the Katy Freeway, the widest free way in United States. They spent $2.2 billion to widen the highway but traffic got worse. Instead of building better infrastructure for alternative modes of transportation, they doubled down to widen the lanes. This would take away 4 religious buildings, 2 schools, 168 homes, 1067 multifamily units and 331 businesses that employ 25,000 people.

From the image, cars do much more damage than a bicycle. Remember this image. It is referenced a lot when it comes to talking about road infrastructure.

Cars only pay half of the road costs. Transportation budget is funded by everyone, regardless if you drive or not. They come from property taxes, sales taxes, income taxes, etc.

One damning quote:

> People who ride bicycles also pay taxes, which means they often pay more into the road system than they cost it. By one estimate, a carfree cyclist would overpay by an average of $250 a year â€“ a few dollars more than the amount the average driver underpays.

These people who rides bicycles are overpaying for roads that they barely damage.
