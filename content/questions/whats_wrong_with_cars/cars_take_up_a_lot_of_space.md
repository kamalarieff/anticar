See how the cars are blocking the roads. It's never cyclists, pedestrians. Cars prevent emergency vehicles to go where they want to.

Cars require a lot of space. You need some space to store them, you need a space at the place where you're going, you need space to slow down. Here is an article that showed the maths.
