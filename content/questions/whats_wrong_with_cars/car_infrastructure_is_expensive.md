Society loses 79 cents per kilometer driven. Society gains 72 cents per kilometer cycled. This is because cycling reduces healthcare costs and sick leave.

In the abstract, it said

> Extrapolated to the total number of passenger kilometers driven, cycled or walked in the European Union, the cost of automobility is about €500 billion per year. Due to positive health effects, cycling is an external benefit worth €24 billion/year and walking €66 billion/year

The cost of highways are paid by all taxpayers, not just the one's that use them. Politicians have been avoiding to raise the gas taxes so the cost are shifted to the general taxpayers instead.

There are some other important points made in this article too, but the one I like the most is:

Swimming in Debt. We have to pay interest and maintenance for all that highways that we built. And the more we build them, the more interest that we have to pay.
