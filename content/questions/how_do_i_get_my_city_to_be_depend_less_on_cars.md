Raise this issue with your local council. Use this site as your talking points. Raise awareness. Talk to your moms, dads, bosses, neighbors.

Refer to documented cycling design. Do note that these documents only serve as a point of reference. Every city is different.

I got this from a video but can't remember which video. Could be useful as well.

I haven't read this yet.

Apply [Market urbanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market%5Furbanism) [[referrer]​](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/rimad7/why%5Fare%5Fjapanese%5Frailway%5Fcompanies%5Fincredibly/) where you implement congestion pricing like Singapore. One good city that has done this is Japan. Japan's railway companies are making a profit. Here is a good text on why they are profitable [reddit.com/r/neoliberal - why\_are\_japanese\_railway\_companies\_incredibly](https://np.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/pzvayh/why%5Fare%5Fjapanese%5Frailway%5Fcompanies%5Fincredibly/)

Some good ideas in here [What can we do? : fuckcars](https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/rmdlcn/what%5Fcan%5Fwe%5Fdo/hplpr29/) like:

-   Some people have started community cargo bike scheme which is an amazing idea [Community E-Cargo Bike Hire Scheme - a Community crowdfunding project in Portsmouth by Nicholas Sebley](https://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/p/community-e-cargo-bike-hire-scheme)
-   I have seen a few countries where a few parents form walking or cycling buses for school children so they all move safely in one large block.
-   In extremely car dependent places, community car pool systems can be a very first step.
-   Planning your next holiday via train and bike
-   In sprawling suburbs where there is street parking anyway, dig up your driveway and make the front of your house an exceptionally beautiful garden instead. If asked about zoning requirements, just say you have a grass driveway but prefer to park in the street.
-   Grow some food at home (reduces shopping trips for fresh fruit/veg)

Need sources for these though.

This video starts off with induced demand. But his main two solutions are to use roundabouts and diverging diamonds. It means that his solutions are still car centric. Not really liking them.

His other solutions are okay. It's about making more pedestrian friendly zones and congestion pricing.

How bollards help filter traffic. Only certain cars can pass through the bollards like buses and delivery vehicles. Cars can also pass through but you need a special pass. When you don't have a special pass, each car has to wait 45 seconds before it can go through. This would deter cars who want to take a shortcut.

Cars only have a single lane both ways so that it makes it more unattractive for them.

You can ask your employers to offer "parking cash out". It's a scheme where people who don't drive to work gets some sort of cash incentive of similar value to those who gets free parking.

> Commuters can continue to drive and park free, or they can take the cash value of the parking subsidy and use it for anything they want, such as putting it toward the rent of an apartment within walking or biking distance of work

There is a lot of benefits to implementing parking cash out.

From the article,

> solo driving to work fell 17%, carpooling increased 64%, transit ridership increased 50%, and walking or biking increased 39%. These changes reduced vehicle travel to work by 12% — equivalent to removing from the road one of every eight cars driven to work. Employers reported that parking cash out was cheap, easy to manage and fair. It also helped them to recruit and retain workers.
