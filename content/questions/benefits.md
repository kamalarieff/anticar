Here is a study from Copenhagen by the Danish Ministry of Transport. The gist of the article is that we shouldn't think about the cost of a bike infrastructure but rather comparing them with a car infrastructure.

The results found that cars cost 0.50 €/km compared to bicycle's 0.08 €/km per **individual**. However, if taking consideration of the costs and benefits of bicycle infrastructure, one kilometre by car costs society €0.15, whereas society earns €0.16 for every kilometre cycled.

The cost of cars comes from air pollution, climate change, noise, congestion, road deterioration, time cost, accident cost, health, vehicle operating costs, and tourism.

From the conclusion in the paper,

> Cycle commuting was associated with a lower risk of CVD, cancer, and all cause mortality. Walking commuting was associated with a lower risk of CVD independent of major measured confounding factors. Initiatives to encourage and support active commuting could reduce risk of death and the burden of important chronic conditions.

Cycling is the best:

> commuting by cycle and by mixed mode including cycling were associated with lower risk of all cause mortality

It reduces cancer by 45% and heart diseases by 46%. You can see it at 4:03 in the referrer video.
