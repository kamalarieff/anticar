### Individual and social costs of car travel more than six times those of cycling {#individual-and-social-costs-of-car-travel-more-than-six-times-those-of-cycling}

<https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/rmoq84/societal_cost_of_driving_vs_cycling/>

Here is a study from Copenhagen by the Danish Ministry of Transport. The gist of the article is that we shouldn't think about the cost of a bike infrastructure but rather comparing them with a car infrastructure.

The results found that cars cost 0.50 €/km compared to bicycle's 0.08 €/km per **individual**. However, if taking consideration of the costs and benefits of bicycle infrastructure, one kilometre by car costs society €0.15, whereas society earns €0.16 for every kilometre cycled.

The cost of cars comes from air pollution, climate change, noise, congestion, road deterioration, time cost, accident cost, health, vehicle operating costs, and tourism.

From the conclusion in the paper,

> Cycle commuting was associated with a lower risk of CVD, cancer, and all cause mortality. Walking commuting was associated with a lower risk of CVD independent of major measured confounding factors. Initiatives to encourage and support active commuting could reduce risk of death and the burden of important chronic conditions.

Cycling is the best:

> commuting by cycle and by mixed mode including cycling were associated with lower risk of all cause mortality

It reduces cancer by 45% and heart diseases by 46%. You can see it at 4:03 in the referrer video.

2.  Traveling by public transportation is 10 times safer per mile than traveling by automobile.
3.  ​Communities that invest in public transit reduce the nation’s carbon emissions by 63 million metric tons annually.

Second, individuals living in walkable neighborhoods are more likely to use transit in general.

Lastly, higher levels of walkability are positively associated with transit use of disabled individuals than others

From the article:

> The research suggests this would significantly improve air quality and noise levels on the car-free streets: ambient levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) would be reduced by a quarter, bringing levels in line with recommendations from the World Health Organisation (WHO).
>
> The plan is also expected to generate significant health benefits for residents. The study estimates that as many as 667 premature deaths from air pollution, noise and heat could be prevented each year. More green spaces will encourage people to get outdoors and lead a more active lifestyle.
>
> This, in turn, helps to reduce obesity and diabetes and ease pressure on health services. The researchers claim that residents of Barcelona could expect to live an extra 200 days thanks to the cumulative health benefits, if the idea is rolled out across the city.
