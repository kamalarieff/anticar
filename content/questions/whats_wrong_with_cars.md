Cars are dangerous, costs a lot of money, creates pollution, takes up a lot of space.

Let's face it. Every time you get behind a wheel, you have to accept that there is a slightly higher chance that you will die. Everything from drivers getting distracted on the road, drunk drivers, emotional drivers, bad road conditions, car troubles, these things can lead to your death.

SUVs is not good for the environment. It is very shocking that just SUVs is second behind an entire industry. They are not aerodynamic, consumes a lot of gas.

> SUVs were the second largest cause of the global rise in carbon dioxide emissions over the past decade, eclipsing all shipping, aviation, heavy industry and even trucks, usually the only vehicles to loom larger than them on the road.

Society loses 79 cents per kilometer driven. Society gains 72 cents per kilometer cycled. This is because cycling reduces healthcare costs and sick leave.

In the abstract, it said

> Extrapolated to the total number of passenger kilometers driven, cycled or walked in the European Union, the cost of automobility is about €500 billion per year. Due to positive health effects, cycling is an external benefit worth €24 billion/year and walking €66 billion/year

He suggested to have better alternatives modes of transportation [11:18].

He also suggested to implement congestion pricing to solve this issue [11:31].

This is the long text format of the video but it has more and better points on why free parking is bad.

For starters, when there is free parking, there is induced demand for those parking. More of those parking spaces gets filled up, people roam more to find empty parking space, which contributes to more congestion and more pollution.

Those free parking is not exactly free. It is paid by everyone in terms of rent and grocery prices.

The experiment stated in the article is pretty interesting. The meter costs change depends on how many people use it. When more people use it, the cost increases. It found that cruising gets cut in half, amount of driving fell by 30 percent, parking citations and double parking also fell.

The cost of highways are paid by all taxpayers, not just the one's that use them. Politicians have been avoiding to raise the gas taxes so the cost are shifted to the general taxpayers instead.

There are some other important points made in this article too, but the one I like the most is:

Swimming in Debt. We have to pay interest and maintenance for all that highways that we built. And the more we build them, the more interest that we have to pay.

Cars only pay half of the road costs. Transportation budget is funded by everyone, regardless if you drive or not. They come from property taxes, sales taxes, income taxes, etc.

One damning quote:

> People who ride bicycles also pay taxes, which means they often pay more into the road system than they cost it. By one estimate, a carfree cyclist would overpay by an average of $250 a year – a few dollars more than the amount the average driver underpays.

These people who rides bicycles are overpaying for roads that they barely damage.
