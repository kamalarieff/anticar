At 2:24, electric cars have more rare materials in them and these materials require a lot of CO2 to mine them. They will only become more environmentally friendly around three or five years of ownership.

At 8:55, electric cars are heavy. This increases the damage done on roads.

> Tesla's quality control is truly a sight to behold. Like some seriously messed up stuff;

> 1.  The roof of a Model Y flew off
> 2.  The roof also tends to leak on the Y
> 3.  The Model 3 also tends to leak
> 4.  The Model X also tends to shed parts
> 5.  There's the general shoddy nature of the trim within Teslas
> 6.  Model Y owners have even found components being held together by fake wood
> 7.  This one's a personal favorite of mine, Tesla told a customer that a broken rear subframe was normal wear &amp; tear

> I of course have not mentioned Tesla's catching on fire killing its drivers which may be of some concern given that the Model 3 does not have a manual rear door release. Nor have I mentioned that it's Self Driving has caused deaths on the road.

> All of this is to say that you should avoid Tesla's because they are the car manufacturer with the most problems in America.
