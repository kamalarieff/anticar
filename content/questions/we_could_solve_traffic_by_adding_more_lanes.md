This is a short term solution. There is a term called induced demand where the better the infrastructure, the more that people will use it. What this will mean is that in 3 years, traffic will resume to bad or worse.

Exact quote?

> Just as with the Katy Freeway expansion, adding new roadway capacity also creates new demand for those lanes or roads, maintaining a similar rate of congestion, if not worsening it.

A lot of numbers in the first referrer article. $500 billion dollars was used to build those highways where you could have built a subway line 111 times over. Maintenance also costs $5 billion per year. There is also a text at the end where some mayor said adding highways would lead to greater economic activity. But there's a finding that contradicts this but I couldn't find that study.
