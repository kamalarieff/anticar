Rural places are often far away, too far that it's not serviceable by public transport. This article's idea is to use on-demand transit service which is a good first step.

There are some success stories. For example, in 2019, Travis County, Texas with a population of 9000 implemented this service. The results:

> In the first three months of service in Manor, ridership increased 285% per day compared to the previous legacy dial-a-ride service, the number of passengers per vehicle per hour increased by four times, and the costs decreased by 50% per passenger. Residents using PickUp get the ease and convenience of a private taxi with the affordability and sustainability of the bus.
