This is the site that writes about Dutch cycling paths. Stuff like Assen.

This is the link that the only way a bicycle path would work if there is a network [A view from the cycle path: the grid](http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/search/label/the%20grid). This is the excerpt:

> For a truly high level of cycling, the grid of cycling infrastructure needs to go everywhere. For instance, the grid must reach:

> -   all homes
> -   all schools
> -   all workplaces
> -   all shops
> -   all sport facilities
> -   all religous buildings

The intersection design is to have the cars pulled a little further back so that they can see the cyclists. The diagrams are for left hand drive so it's a bit confusing but it's still okay.

The design is based on the Dutch implementation.

Gronigen, the leading city for cycling in the world [15:31]. They introduced superblocks back in 1977 [1:44]. The idea is that cars have a ring road that goes around the city but they can never go through the superblocks. Cyclists have a more direct access rather than cars making cycling the better option for transportation.

### Elevated Bike PathsðŸ˜ƒ : fuckcars {#elevated-bike-paths-fuckcars}

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2022-02-14_20:19 elevated bike paths.jpg" >}}

Bike paths that are separated from any cars. A redditor wrote a good description of it.

> This is Cykelslangen in Copenhagen. It's a pretty nice piece of infrastructure, connecting a bike/pedestrian bridge across the harbour to another bridge going to the Vesterbro neighbourhood. The Cykelslangen bridge bypasses a nice area by the water which bikes had to cross through before the bridge.
