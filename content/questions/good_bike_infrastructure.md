This is the site that writes about Dutch cycling paths. Stuff like Assen.

This is the link that the only way a bicycle path would work if there is a network [A view from the cycle path: the grid](http://www.aviewfromthecyclepath.com/search/label/the%20grid). This is the excerpt:

> For a truly high level of cycling, the grid of cycling infrastructure needs to go everywhere. For instance, the grid must reach:

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxn-B4OuONY>

The intersection design is to have the cars pulled a little further back so that they can see the cyclists. The diagrams are for left hand drive so it's a bit confusing but it's still okay.

The design is based on the Dutch implementation.

Gronigen, the leading city for cycling in the world [15:31]. They introduced superblocks back in 1977 [1:44]. The idea is that cars have a ring road that goes around the city but they can never go through the superblocks. Cyclists have a more direct access rather than cars making cycling the better option for transportation.

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/2022-02-14_20:19 elevated bike paths.jpg" >}}

Bike paths that are separated from any cars. A redditor wrote a good description of it.

> This is Cykelslangen in Copenhagen. It's a pretty nice piece of infrastructure, connecting a bike/pedestrian bridge across the harbour to another bridge going to the Vesterbro neighbourhood. The Cykelslangen bridge bypasses a nice area by the water which bikes had to cross through before the bridge.

But the city is divided in a way that cars can't cross into another part of the city. They have to go out back onto the ring road. Bikes are able to cross just fine.

Houten was awarded Netherlands best place to cycle in 2018. This suburb is built into 4 subdistricts where cars can only enter each district via one entry.

However, bicycles can go through to all subdistricts directly which make them faster than cars.
