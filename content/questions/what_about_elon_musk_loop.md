Some expectation vs reality of the loop. The video progresses from the initial concept to its current implementation.

This video goes through the initial promises of the loop and the actual reality of it. For example, at 5:11, the proposed Loop speed is 150mph but next, the reporter said it's just 30mph.

A very good video that debunks the Loop just by using common sense. He also went through statistics. For example, how Tesla's rank second to last on reliablity [2:45]. He also went through some maths on the carrying capacity of the Loop [5:10].
