<https://www.reddit.com/r/fuckcars/comments/sq2oi8/burgos_spain_25_years_of_pedestrianization/hwio90q/>

> Burgos is a small city situated in Northern Spain. Like most of the western world, Spain saw unprecedented economic growth during the second half of the twentieth century, which among other things made cars affordable for the masses. This resulted in what you can see in the “old” pictures below – a car-infested city throughout the late 60s, the 70s and 80s.
>
> Initiatives were started in the mid-to-late-90s to pedestrianize some streets around the historical center, which eventually grew to encompass the whole city core. These continued efforts won Burgos the CiViTAs City of the Year in 2007, and the Energy Globe Award in 2008. Urban renewal initiatives continue, and the city has now announced further plans for a 2-sq km Low Emission Zone with further restrictions for motor vehicles.

> Serfaus is a small ski village with about 1200 inhabitants and about 7000 hotel beds. About 50 years ago, they decided their village road can't take all the ski tourists anymore, banned private cars in the village, and build a parking lot outside to serve it by bus.

> You can probably guess what came next: buses hit their capacity limit and in 1984, they started building a subway line instead. It is
> 1.3 km (0.81 mi) long, serves 4 stations today and can transport up to 3000 people per hour. It has been under renovation from 2017 to 2019. It is driver-less.
