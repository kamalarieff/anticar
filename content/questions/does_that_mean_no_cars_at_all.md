No. There are some things that require cars e.g. delivery drivers, truck drivers, ambulances, fire trucks, anyone whose job depend on a car, if you live in the country side where things are so far apart. But for the rest of us who only goes back and forth to the office, we don't really need a car. Public transport, walkability and good bike infrastructure suits us much better.

Even those who use a car for work, once you get home, you can leave your car at home and use your bicycle to get around to your local shops. This is called multimodal transportation. It's not like if you have a car, you have to use it everywhere.

Most rides you do are just under 5km from your house. This is doable via bicycle.

For places with vast distances between them, we should rely on public transport e.g. trains, buses.

Even if you do need a car, there is always car sharing programs.
