## What is anti-car dependency? {#what-is-anti-car-dependency}

This site serves as a bible for all things regarding anti-car dependency. You have a question? Just find it in the sidebar.

However, if you want an overview what anti-car dependency is about, you can read further.


### Build cities for people, not cars. {#build-cities-for-people-not-cars-dot}

Climate change is upon us. We have to change now or the world will soon be inhabitable.

We don't actually need cars for everything in our daily lives. We should build our city around people not cars. This means better walkability, better bike infrastructure, better public transport.

Cars should be optional, not necessary.


#### What's wrong with cars? {#what-s-wrong-with-cars}

-  Cars pollute

    A report said that [Earth has 11 years to cut emissions to avoid dire climate scenarios](https://www.npr.org/2021/11/04/1052267118/climate-change-carbon-dioxide-emissions-global-carbon-budget). From this [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967070X21003401?via%3Dihub), it said that

    > Transport is responsible for 24% of global direct carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from fuel combustion

    Another [article](https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions-from-transport) cites that

    > Transport accounts for around one-fifth of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions

    Where

    > Road travel accounts for three-quarters of transport emissions. Most of this comes from passenger vehicles – cars and buses.

    Tire wear contributes to the microplastics in the environment. From this [research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326063101%5FTire%5FAbrasion%5Fas%5Fa%5FMajor%5FSource%5Fof%5FMicroplastics%5Fin%5Fthe%5FEnvironment) and [article](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-39042655),

    > 30 vol% of the microplastic particles that pollute rivers, lakes and oceans consist of tire wear, thus affecting aquatic wildlife.

    The best way to reduce all this pollution in a short time frame is to reduce cars. Electric cars can help but they can't come fast enough. We need immediate action and we need it now.

-  Car infrastructure is expensive to maintain

    From this [paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330184791%5FThe%5FSocial%5FCost%5Fof%5FAutomobility%5FCycling%5Fand%5FWalking%5Fin%5Fthe%5FEuropean%5FUnion), it said

    > Extrapolated to the total number of passenger kilometers driven, cycled or walked in the European Union, the cost of automobility is about €500 billion per year. Due to positive health effects, cycling is an external benefit worth €24 billion/year and walking €66 billion/year.

-  Cars are not accessible to everyone

    Cars are only accessible to a subset of people. For these categories of people [[source]​](https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2021/9/27/the-hidden-inequity-of-car-based-design),

    1.  Children and Teenagers
        -   they can't drive
    2.  Stay-at-Home Parents
        -   parents who have no choice to drive when running errands
    3.  The Income-Vulnerable
        -   they can't afford to drive
    4.  Senior Citizens
        -   they can't drive

    They are limited to all sorts of services just because they can't drive.

-  Cars waste our time

    People stuck in traffic are wasting time. Time that can be spent on other things. All this time wasted comes down to a figure. From this [article](https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-chicago-traffic-eisenhower-stevenson-20211207-cchal6znbrayzjhqsovq3f77ce-story.html),

    > $1,622 in time wasted for the average Chicago driver, and $5.8 billion for the city,

-  Cars take up a lot of space

    These are valuable spaces only dedicated for cars. Space that could have been used to build parks, homes, shops, etc. Not only space on the roads, but space when they are parked too. According to this [article](https://usa.streetsblog.org/2016/03/10/its-true-the-typical-car-is-parked-95-percent-of-the-time/),

    > Cars are parked 95 percent of the time.

-  Cars are dangerous

    Human beings make mistakes. But when they make mistakes behind the wheel, people's lives are lost. The recent [accident](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2021/12/18/midnight-tragedy-eight-children-and-two-adults-killed-in-pile-up-on-elite-highway) that killed 8 children on the ELITE highway proved that. In fact, The [Department of Statistics](https://www.dosm.gov.my/v1/index.php?r=column/cthemeByCat&cat=401&bul%5Fid=R3VrRUhwSXZDN2k4SGN6akRhTStwQT09&menu%5Fid=L0pheU43NWJwRWVSZklWdzQ4TlhUUT09#:~:text=causes%20of%20death-,Ischaemic%20heart%20diseases%20remained%20as%20the%20principal%20causes%20of%20death,bronchus%20and%20lung%20(2.5%25).) reported that 3165 people died last year from traffic accidents alone.

    This does not include the amount of people injured by vehicles.


#### What can we do? {#what-can-we-do}

We should provide better alternatives to cars. This means that we need to improve on walkability, bikability and better public transportation.

Take away car lanes to build better sidewalks, better bike paths and better bus lanes.

This [research](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/330184791%5FThe%5FSocial%5FCost%5Fof%5FAutomobility%5FCycling%5Fand%5FWalking%5Fin%5Fthe%5FEuropean%5FUnion) said,

> Society loses 79 cents per kilometer driven. Society gains 72 cents per kilometer cycled. This is because cycling reduces healthcare costs and sick leave.

Another [research](https://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/research/newsalert/pdf/transport%5Ftransitions%5Fin%5Fcopenhagen%5F418na1%5Fen.pdf) suggested

> Individual and social costs of car travel more than six times those of cycling

Since cars are just heavy metal boxes that are capable of murder, they should yield and make way for pedestrians and cyclists. Give priority to pedestrians and cyclists since they are the most vulnerable users of the road.

Roads belong to all people, not just people with cars.
